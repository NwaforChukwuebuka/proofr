# PROOFR — API (as-built)

The frozen spec is [api-contracts.md](api-contracts.md). This doc tracks what's *actually implemented* — real request/response examples, auth headers, and which pieces are mocked — updated milestone by milestone. If this file and `api-contracts.md` disagree, this file wins; go fix the contract doc to match.

## `POST /api/merchants`
*Milestone 2. Implemented in [app/api/merchants/route.ts](app/api/merchants/route.ts).*

Public signup. No auth.

**Request**
```json
{
  "phone": "+2348012345678",
  "email": "merchant@example.com",
  "password": "SuperSecret123!",
  "businessName": "Test Suya Spot",
  "bvnOrNin": "12345678901"
}
```
- `phone`, `email`, `password`, `businessName` are required, non-empty strings.
- `phone` must be **E.164** format (e.g. `+2348012345678`) — Supabase Auth rejects other formats with a 400.
- `bvnOrNin` is **optional**, not in the frozen contract — added so KYC can run inline at signup instead of needing a separate endpoint (no new DB columns were added; see `data-model.md`). Omit it to sign up with `bvn_nin_verified: false`.

**Response `201`**
```json
{ "merchantId": "313aaea8-3317-4639-b161-07e152cb96c6", "approvalStatus": "pending" }
```

**Errors**
- `400` — missing/empty required field, non-JSON body, bad `bvnOrNin` type, or Supabase Auth rejecting the input (e.g. bad phone format, duplicate email).
- `500` — merchant row insert failed after the auth user was created (the auth user is rolled back/deleted in this case).

**What happens server-side**
1. Creates a Supabase Auth user via the service-role client (`auth.admin.createUser`, `email_confirm: true`).
2. If `bvnOrNin` was provided, calls `mockVerifyBvnNin` ([lib/kyc.ts](lib/kyc.ts)) — **mocked**, see below.
3. Inserts the `merchants` row (`auth_user_id`, `business_name`, `phone`, `email`, `approval_status: "pending"`, `bvn_nin_verified`, `kyc_reference`).

**Mocked: BVN/NIN verification.** No Monnify (or other) sandbox KYC endpoint was reachable with the env vars in `.env.local.example` (`MONNIFY_*` are still empty). `mockVerifyBvnNin` deterministically marks any 10–11 digit string as verified and returns a `MOCK-KYC-<hash>` reference — obviously named so it's a one-line swap once real Monnify sandbox KYC credentials exist. See the [[monnify-sandbox-only]] memory note: check Monnify's sandbox docs for a real BVN/NIN endpoint before assuming this stays mocked.

## `POST /api/merchants/:id/approve`
*Milestone 2 (approval flip only — Monnify account issuance is milestone 4). Implemented in [app/api/merchants/[id]/approve/route.ts](app/api/merchants/[id]/approve/route.ts).*

**Auth**: header `x-admin-secret: <ADMIN_API_SECRET>` — a minimal shared-secret gate, **not** real admin auth (that's milestone 14). `ADMIN_API_SECRET` is a new env var (see `.env.local.example`); must be set identically in Render's env vars and locally in `.env`.

**Request**: `{}` (body ignored beyond needing to be present)

**Response `200`**
```json
{ "merchantId": "313aaea8-3317-4639-b161-07e152cb96c6", "approvalStatus": "approved", "monnifyAccountNumber": null }
```

**Errors**
- `401` — missing/wrong `x-admin-secret` header.
- `404` — no merchant with that id.
- `500` — `ADMIN_API_SECRET` not configured on the server, or the update failed.

**Mocked: `monnifyAccountNumber` is always `null`.** This route only flips `approval_status` to `approved`. Real Monnify reserved virtual account issuance is milestone 4's job — the hook point is marked in the route with a comment; wire the real call in right before the `monnifyAccountNumber` variable is set.

## Not yet implemented

Everything else in `api-contracts.md` (`GET /api/merchants/:id/revenue`, `POST /api/webhooks/monnify`, reports, lender routes, loans, admin fraud queue) — see `plan.md` for which milestone owns each.
